{"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "accessLevel": "public", "accrualPeriodicity": "R/P1D", "bureauCode": ["009:00"], "contactPoint": {"fn": "National Center for Health Statistics", "hasEmail": "mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, "description": "<p>The provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified that have been received and coded. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks.</p>\n<p>The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), and pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19; (a) by week ending date, (b) by age at death, and (c) by specific jurisdictions. Future updates to this release may include additional detail such as demographic characteristics (e.g., sex), additional causes of death (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome or other comorbidities), or estimates based on models that account for reporting delays to generate more accurate predicted provisional counts.</p>\n<p>Pneumonia deaths are included to provide context for understanding the completeness of COVID-19 mortality data and related trends. Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition. Thus, increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality. Additionally, estimates of completeness for pneumonia deaths may provide context for understanding the lag in reporting for COVID-19 deaths, as it is anticipated that these causes would have similar delays in reporting, processing, and coding. However, it is possible that reporting of COVID-19 mortality may be slower or faster than for other causes of death, and that the delay may change over time. Analyses to better understand and quantify reporting delays for COVID-19 deaths and related causes are underway. The list of causes provided in these tables may expand in future releases as more data are received, and other potentially comorbid conditions are determined.</p>\n<p>Technical notes</p>\n<p>Comparing data in this report to other sources</p>\n<p>Provisional death counts in this report will not match counts in other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Death data, once received and processed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), are tabulated by the state or jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent\u2019s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems.  Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cause.  Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths.  This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources. Provisional counts reported here track approximately 1\u20132 weeks behind other published data sources on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (1,2,3).</p>\n<p>Nature and sources of data</p>\n<p>Provisional death c</p>\n", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hc4f-j6nb/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "format": "csv", "mediaType": "application/unknown", "title": "csv"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hc4f-j6nb/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "format": "rdf", "mediaType": "application/unknown", "title": "rdf"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hc4f-j6nb/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "format": "json", "mediaType": "application/unknown", "title": "json"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hc4f-j6nb/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "format": "xsl", "mediaType": "application/unknown", "title": "xsl"}], "identifier": "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hc4f-j6nb", "issued": "2020-04-23", "keyword": ["age", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "deaths", "mortality", "nchs", "pneumonia", "state", "united states"], "landingPage": "https://data.cdc.gov/d/hc4f-j6nb", "modified": "2020-11-10", "programCode": ["009:020"], "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "temporal": "2019-01-01T05:00:00-05:00/2020-12-31T05:00:00-05:00", "theme": ["NCHS"], "title": "Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"}
