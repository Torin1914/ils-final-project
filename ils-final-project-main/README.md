This directory is organized by type of data used. All of the original unaltered raw data that we evaulated is stored in the directory Original-Data-Raw.
Any Summary data that we used, such as the percent of the population who has diabetes per various ages, can be found unaltered in Collected-Summarized-Data.
Finally, any analyzed or altered data can be found in Analyzed-Data-Files as both an Excel file or a Comma Separated Value file.
